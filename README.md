# zip-all-files
This script makes separate zip archives for all files in current dir and sub-dirs.
It is intended for preparing archived text files for BookReaders.

USE: just copy and run the ZIPP.PY in the directory in which you want to zip files (files in sub-dirs will be included).

OUTPUT: It will make new dir "your_dir_name-archived", copying all sub-dirs structure, and put inside separate zipped files from init dir.
